            <h3>Our Family Background</h3>
            <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time.Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Italian-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.</p>
